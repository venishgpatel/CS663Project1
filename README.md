# Automatically identifying, counting, and describing animals (Research Tutorial)

* In a Computer Vision class, students required to research on one topic and present it to the class by building website. So, I researched on **animal identification using deep convolutional neural networks.** To present this topic, I developed this website in the form of slides.

* Live website on GitHub Pages: https://wanicepatel1210.github.io/CS663Project1/
