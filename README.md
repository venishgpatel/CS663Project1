### Automatically identifying, counting, and describing animals (Research Tutorial)

* For a Computer Vision course requirement, students research any computer vision related topic and present it to the class by building a website. So, I researched on *animal identification using deep convolutional neural networks.* To present my topic, I developed this website in the form of slides.

* **University:** Cal State Eastbay.
* **Course:** Computer Vision (CS 663).
